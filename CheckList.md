## Naming Convention in Java

Naming conventions in Java are widely followed to enhance code readability and maintain consistency among programmers. Here are the common naming conventions in Java:

1. Packages: Package names are written in lowercase letters and are typically in the form of reversed domain names, such as `com.example.myproject`.
2. Classes and Interfaces: Class and interface names start with an uppercase letter and use CamelCase. For example, `MyClass`, `MyInterface`.
3. Methods: Method names also start with a lowercase letter and use CamelCase. They should be descriptive and indicate the action performed by the method. For example, `calculateTotal`, `getUserDetails`.
4. Variables: Variable names start with a lowercase letter and use CamelCase. They should be descriptive and indicate the purpose of the variable. For example, `count`, `firstName`.
5. Constants: Constants are declared using uppercase letters with underscores between words. For example, `MAX_SIZE`, `PI_VALUE`.
6. Packages and Classes: Names of packages and classes should be nouns or noun phrases that represent the purpose or content of the package or class.
7. Methods and Functions: Names of methods and functions should be verbs or verb phrases that indicate the action or operation performed.
8. Booleans: Names of boolean variables and methods that return a boolean value should be in the form of a question or statement that can be answered with "true" or "false". For example, `isReady`, `hasPermission`.
9. Acronyms: Acronyms and abbreviations should be written in uppercase for class names (`XMLParser`) and lowercase for method names (`getHTTPResponse`).
