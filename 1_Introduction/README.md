## Some knowledge about Java

### Java Fundamental

The essence of Java is a library consists of classes with some program. Classes in Java can be reused in many program, help coder to save many time when develope software and determine bug in program.

### How java programs run

We use IDE to programming code and save as .java file. Java file will be complied to  .class file. JVM is interpreter be installed in different operating system, like window, linus, Mac OS.

### Java Native Interface

JNI acts as a bridge for permitting the supporting packages for other programming languages such as C, C++, and so on. This is especially helpful in cases where you need to write code that is not entirely supported by Java, like some platform specific features that can only be written in C.

### Native Method Libraries

Native Method Libraries are libraries that are written in other programming languages, such as C, C++, and assembly. These libraries are usually present in the form of .dll or .so files. These native libraries can be loaded through JNI.

### Garbage Collection
Garbage Collection is process of cleaning and release memory not being used in JVM. Java use GC to manages Heap, which store object in running program.
